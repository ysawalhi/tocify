arXiv:2602.07348v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We perform axisymmetric numerical simulations to investigate the coalescence dynamics of a liquid drop in a deep liquid pool. This study aims to generalize the mechanisms of partial coalescence across a range of drop shapes, elucidate the underlying mechanism of neck oscillations, and examine the roles of inertial, viscous and gravitational forces, quantified by the Weber, Ohnesorge, and Bond numbers, in governing the coalescence behavior. A phase …

arXiv:2602.08045v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: It is shown that the upper limit on the fraction of power that can be extracted from an airstream approaching a wind turbine is about 78% rather than the historical value of 59%. This higher limit is based on the assumption that the wind turbine cannot accelerate the flow at its exit plane above the freestream velocity. The derivation of the historical limit of 59% must either violate the angular momentum equation or the continuity equation.

arXiv:2602.07797v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Accurate prediction of aerothermal loads in hypersonic flows is critical yet challenging due to the coupling of Shock-Wave/Boundary-Layer Interactions (SBLI) and thermal non-equilibrium. This work presents the development of a three-dimensional two-temperature Gas-Kinetic Scheme (3D 2T-GKS) on unstructured meshes. The scheme resolves translational-rotational and vibrational energy modes within a unified kinetic framework. A key innovation is the in…
