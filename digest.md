<p>A high-frequency dynamic calibration system for pressure-sensitive paint (PSP) was developed using cavity-induced jets. The dominant frequency for dynamic calibration was adjusted to the range of 9–16 kHz by scaling the cavity. The dominant flapping frequencies corresponding to different cavity lengths were identified. The distributions of pressure fluctuations across cavities were measured using fast PSP technology.

In the current study, we propose a method to study such flows through the study of a relatively flat turbulent free surface laden with spherical floating particles (“floaters”). The free surface is perturbed by a relatively low-mean nearly homogeneous subsurface turbulent flow that is produce…
