In microbiota, within-community diversity is often linked to host health, which makes it all the more important to understand. Since many communities assemble de novo, microbial dispersal plays a critical role in shaping community structure during the early stages of assembly. While theoretical models typically assume microbes disperse individually, this overlooks cases wh…
