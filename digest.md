# Weekly ToC Digest (week of 2026-02-07)

No items closely matching the selected interests, but some papers have peripheral relevance. No items met the relevance criteria this week, as they mostly focused outside the specified interests, including non-neural dynamics and clinical-only studies. Prioritized based on interest in methods for neural time series, oscillations, cross-species electrophysiology, and physiological signal processing. No items from this week's RSS feed satisfy the specified interests. All items were heavily down weighted due to their focus on non-relevant fields such as cancer, immunology, and purely behavioral studies.

## [Dissecting Resting-State Plasticity: Mesoscale Calcium Imaging of Excitatory and Inhibitory Neuronal Population Network Reorganization in Early Blind Mice](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.02.06.704389v1?rss=1)
*bioRxiv*  
Score: **0.40**  
Published: 2026-02-07T00:00:00+00:00

<summary>RSS summary</summary>

Early sensory deprivation profoundly alters cortical organization, yet the cell-type specific mechanisms driving large-scale functional reconfiguration remain poorly understood. Here, we combined wide-field mesoscale calcium imaging with cell-type specific promoters (hSyn, Thy1, mDLX) to quantify resting-state functional connectivity across pan-neuronal, excitatory, and inhibitory networks in sighted and neonatal enucleated mice. Using graph-theoretic analyses of spontaneous cortical activity, w…
