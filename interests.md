## scoring block
Scoring calibration:
Score ≥ 0.80 ONLY if the item clearly involves electrophysiology or physiological time series
  (EEG/MEG/LFP/iEEG/ECoG/neuronal spiking) OR aperiodic/1/f, oscillations, waveform shape,
  spectral parameterization, or neuronal timescales — OR introduces a general time-series/signal
  processing method that would transfer to those data.

If it is primarily about drugs/behavior/psychiatric symptoms without neural/physio time-series analysis,
  cap score at 0.40.

If it is primarily microbiology/immunology/metabolism/genetics without neural dynamics methods,
  cap score at 0.25. -->

## narrative
We are focused on solving complex flow problems while advancing the state of the art of experimental techniques. Our research philosophy is driven by three cross-cutting areas: to gain physical insights as well as validate numerical models; to develop non-intrusive laser and optical diagnostics that are multi-scale, multi-physics, and deployable in-situ; to design and instrument unique facilities.

We are active in three core areas: Wall-Bounded Turbulence, Multiphase Flows, and Fluid-Structure Interaction. Our applications range from industrial to environmental flows with a strong focus on naval applications and nuclear thermal-hydraulics and security.

Some of my paper titles include:
* Single camera stereoscopic PIV application to a turbulent confined swirling layer with free surface
* Options for scaled experiments for high temperature liquid salt and helium fluid mechanics and convective heat transfer
* Four‑view single‑camera plenoptic 3.0 imager for three‑dimensional Lagrangian particle tracking in an oscillatory laminar boundary layer
* Near‑wall volumetric molecular tagging velocimetry with a Fourier integral microscope
