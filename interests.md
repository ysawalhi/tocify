## scoring block
Scoring calibration:
Score ≥ 0.80 ONLY if the item clearly involves electrophysiology or physiological time series
  (EEG/MEG/LFP/iEEG/ECoG/neuronal spiking) OR aperiodic/1/f, oscillations, waveform shape,
  spectral parameterization, or neuronal timescales — OR introduces a general time-series/signal
  processing method that would transfer to those data.

If it is primarily about drugs/behavior/psychiatric symptoms without neural/physio time-series analysis,
  cap score at 0.40.

If it is primarily microbiology/immunology/metabolism/genetics without neural dynamics methods,
  cap score at 0.25. -->

## narrative
We are focused on solving complex flow problems while advancing the state of the art of experimental techniques. Our research philosophy is driven by three cross-cutting areas: to gain physical insights as well as validate numerical models; to develop non-intrusive laser and optical diagnostics that are multi-scale, multi-physics, and deployable in-situ; to design and instrument unique facilities.

We are active in three core areas: Wall-Bounded Turbulence, Multiphase Flows, and Fluid-Structure Interaction. Our applications range from industrial to environmental flows with a strong focus on naval applications and nuclear thermal-hydraulics and security.

The Thermo-Fluids Lab is located on the GW Foggy Bottom Campus in the heart of Washington DC.  We have space in the Science and Engineering Hall (SEH) and Tompkins Hall.  Additionally, we have a satellite lab on the GW Virginia Science and Technology Campus in Ashburn, VA.

A-Lab: SEH 3300A– We have 1320 sq ft of shared space to develop laser and optical diagnostics and operate small facilities.

B-Lab: Tompkins B03 – This is where we do Big things.  This lab is a 1540 sq ft high bay with 3 cranes, 300 kVA of electrical power, strong floor, and adjacent support rooms.  It currently houses the Sloshing Tank, Index Match Loop, the new Free Surface Loop, and a four column hydraulic press.

The laboratory has a 30 gpm hydraulic pump with accumulators to operate hydraulic actuators.  It also has two steam supplies and water treatment and purification systems.  Additionally, the laboratory is equipped with adequate laser safety system to operate a broad range of lasers.

The TF Lab is equipped with a broad suite of laser systems, cameras, synchronization, and characterization hardware.  The lab has several data acquisition systems, oscilloscopes, spectrometers, refractometer, etc …

We are striving to conduct multi-physics and multi-scale experiments.  We have thus expanded into laser spectroscopic techniques. We are continuously pushing the limits of existing diagnostics and developing new concepts.  Many of our tools are not commercially available which forces us to develop all aspects of instruments integration and data analysis. This enables us to have a deeper understanding of uncertainties associated with our measurements.  

Our work has been reported in 40 peer-reviewed Journal Publications and 122 Conference Proceedings and Abstracts. We present our work every year at the Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics (DFD) and AIAA SciTech Forum as well as at the biennial International Symposium on Applications of Laser and Imaging Techniques to Fluid Mechanics (Lisbon Symposium), Symposium on Naval Hydrodynamics (SNH), and International Topical Meeting on Nuclear Reactor Thermal Hydraulics (NURETH).

Some of my paper titles include:
* Single camera stereoscopic PIV application to a turbulent confined swirling layer with free surface
* Options for scaled experiments for high temperature liquid salt and helium fluid mechanics and convective heat transfer
* Four‑view single‑camera plenoptic 3.0 imager for three‑dimensional Lagrangian particle tracking in an oscillatory laminar boundary layer
* Near‑wall volumetric molecular tagging velocimetry with a Fourier integral microscope
